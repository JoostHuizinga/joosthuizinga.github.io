I am a Ph. D. student at the University of Wyoming and I am working in
the Evolving Artificial Intelligence Laboratory led by Jeff Clune. My
research interests are in Evolutionary Algorithms, Neural Networks,
Evolutionary Robotics, Learning Algorithms and almost every other
aspect of Artificial Intelligence.<br>

Work is done as part of the Evolving Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory led by dr. Jeff Clune. The lab consists of bright and
creative Ph. D., Master, and Undergraduate students who are all working
on different areas in our field such as the evolution of hierarchically
structures, the relation between structure and learning, the properties
of novelty based evolution and more, but who all have the mutual goal
of making computers and robots smarter through the use of evolution.

<span class="general_header1">Evolving Artificial Intelligence</span><br>
<span class="text_block">In the Evolving Artificial Intelligence Lab we
use the principle of Evolution to help us produce smarter computers and
robots. To do this we start with a set of randomly generated artificial
brains which will be the individuals of our experiment. We then test
these individuals on a specific task, for example we might place one of
these artificial brains inside a simulated quadruped and measure how
far the quadruped walks. Those individuals that perform better than
their colleagues are allowed to produce offspring. The offspring is
either a combination of two parents or a clone of the parent to which
we then apply some minor mutations. The idea is that the minor change
might improve the individuals performance making it better than its
parents and thus, very slowly, helping the evolutionary process solve
the task. In the last step we will select the next generation from
among both parents and children based on their performance such that
the total population size stays the same and from there we continue the
process, generation after generation, until the problem is solved or
until some predetermined number of generations.

<span class="general_header1">Current Research</span><br>
<span class="text_block_last">My current research tries to make these
artificial brains look more like natural brains by mimicking the
modular and regular structures found in natural brains. To do this I
combine an algorithm known as HyperNEAT, which is known to generate
regular structures, with an evolutionary cost for having longer
connections, which was shown to produce more modular structures. The
hope is that these modular and regular brains are more evolvable, that
is, that it is easier for evolution to build upon these structured
brains in order to produce more intelligence.
